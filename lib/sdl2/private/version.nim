##  version.nim
##  ===========
##
##  This header defines the current SDL version.

type
  Version* = object ##  \
    ##  Information the version of SDL in use.
    ##
    ##  Represents the library's version as three levels: major revision
    ##  (increments with massive changes, additions, and enhancements),
    ##  minor revision (increments with backwards-compatible changes to the
    ##  major revision), and patchlevel (increments with fixes to the minor
    ##  revision).

    ##  ``getVersion``
    major*: uint8           ## major version
    minor*: uint8           ## minor version
    patch*: uint8           ## update version

# Printable format: "$1.$2.$3" % [MAJOR, MINOR, PATCHLEVEL]

  MAJOR_VERSION* = 2
  MINOR_VERSION* = 0
  PATCHLEVEL* = 8

template version*(x: untyped) = ##  \
  ##  Template to determine SDL version program was compiled against.
  ##
  ##  This template fills in a Version object with the version of the
  ##  library you compiled against. This is determined by what header the
  ##  compiler uses. Note that if you dynamically linked the library, you might
  ##  have a slightly newer or older version at runtime. That version can be
  ##  determined with getVersion(), which, unlike version(),
  ##  is not a template.
  ##
  ##  ``x`` Version object to initialize.
  ##
  ##  See also:

  ##  ``Version``
  ##
  ##  ``getVersion``
  (x).major = MAJOR_VERSION
  (x).minor = MINOR_VERSION
  (x).patch = PATCHLEVEL

template versionNum*(x, y, z: untyped): untyped = ##  \
  ##  This template turns the version numbers into a numeric value:
  ##
  ##  `(1,2,3) -> (1203)`
  ##
  ##  This assumes that there will never be more than 100 patchlevels.
  ((x) * 1000 + (y) * 100 + (z))

const
  COMPILEDVERSION* = versionNum(MAJOR_VERSION, MINOR_VERSION, PATCHLEVEL) ##  \
    ##  This is the version number const for the current SDL version.

template versionAtLeast*(x, y, z: untyped): bool = ##  \
  ##  This templaye will evaluate to true if compiled with SDL
  ##  at least ``x``.``y``.``z``.
  (COMPILEDVERSION >= versionNum(x, y, z))

proc getVersion*(ver: ptr Version) {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetVersion", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the version of SDL that is linked against your program.
  ##
  ##  If you are linking to SDL dynamically, then it is possible that the
  ##  current version will be different than the version you compiled against.
  ##  This procedure returns the current version, while version() is a
  ##  template that tells you what version you compiled with.
  ##
  ##  .. code-block:: nim
  ##    var compiled, linked: Version
  ##    version(compiled)
  ##    getVersion(addr(linked))
  ##    echo("We compiled against SDL version $1.$2.$3 ...", [$compiled.major, $compiled.minor, $compiled.patch])
  ##    echo("But we linked against SDL version $1.$2.$3.", [$linked.major, $linked.minor, $linked.patch])
  ##
  ##  This procedure may be called safely at any time, even before ``init()``.

proc getRevision*(): cstring {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetRevision", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the code revision of SDL that is linked against your program.
  ##
  ##  Returns an arbitrary string (a hash value) uniquely identifying the
  ##  exact revision of the SDL library in use, and is only useful in comparing
  ##  against other revisions. It is NOT an incrementing number.

proc getRevisionNumber*(): cint {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetRevisionNumber", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the revision number of SDL that is linked against your program.
  ##
  ##  Returns a number uniquely identifying the exact revision of the SDL
  ##  library in use. It is an incrementing number based on commits to
  ##  hg.libsdl.org.
