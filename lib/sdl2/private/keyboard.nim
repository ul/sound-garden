    ##  see the TEXTINPUT event.

# Procedures

proc getKeyboardFocus*(): ptr Window {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetKeyboardFocus", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the window which currently has keyboard focus.

proc getKeyboardState*(numkeys: ptr cint): ptr array[NUM_SCANCODES.int, uint8] {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetKeyboardState", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get a snapshot of the current state of the keyboard.
  ##
  ##  ``numkeys`` if non-`nil`, receives the length of the returned array.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` an array of key states. Indexes into this array are obtained
  ##  by using ``Scancode`` values.
  ##
  ##  Example:
  ##
  ##  .. code-block:: nim
  ##    let state = getKeyboardState(nil)
  ##    if state[SCANCODE_RETURN] > 0:
  ##      echo "<RETURN> is pressed."

template `[]`*[Idx, T](a: array[Idx, T], x: Scancode): T = a[x.int]

proc getModState*(): Keymod {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetModState", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the current key modifier state for the keyboard.

proc setModState*(modstate: Keymod) {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_SetModState", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Set the current key modifier state for the keyboard.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` This does not change the keyboard state,
  ##  only the key modifier flags.

proc getKeyFromScancode*(scancode: Scancode): Keycode {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetKeyFromScancode", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the key code corresponding to the given scancode according
  ##  to the current keyboard layout.
  ##
  ##  See ``Keycode`` for details.
  ##
  ##  See also:
  ##
  ##  ``getKeyName()``

proc getScancodeFromKey*(key: Keycode): Scancode {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetScancodeFromKey", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the scancode corresponding to the given key code
  ##  according to the current keyboard layout.
  ##
  ##  See ``Scancode`` for details.
  ##
  ##  See also:
  ##
  ##  ``getScancodeName()``

proc getScancodeName*(scancode: Scancode): cstring {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetScancodeName", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get a human-readable name for a scancode.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` a pointer to the name for the scancode.
  ##  If the scancode doesn't have a name, this procedure
  ##  returns an empty string ("").

  ##  See also:
  ##
  ##  ``Scancode``

proc getScancodeFromName*(name: cstring): Scancode {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetScancodeFromName", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get a scancode from a human-readable name.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` scancode, or `SCANCODE_UNKNOWN` if the name wasn't recognized.
  ##
  ##  See also:
  ##
  ##  ``Scancode``

proc getKeyName*(key: Keycode): cstring {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetKeyName", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get a human-readable name for a key.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` a pointer to a UTF-8 string that stays valid at least until
  ##  the next call to this procedure. If you need it around any longer,
  ##  you must copy it. If the key doesn't have a name, this procedure returns
  ##  an empty string ("").

  ##
  ##  ``Keycode``

proc getKeyFromName*(name: cstring): Keycode {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetKeyFromName", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get a key code from a human-readable name.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` key code, or `K_UNKNOWN` if the name wasn't recognized.
