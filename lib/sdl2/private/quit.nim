##  quit.nim
##  ========
##
##  Include file for SDL quit event handling.

##  A `QUIT` event is generated when the user tries to close the application
##  window.  If it is ignored or filtered out, the window will remain open.
##  If it is not ignored or filtered, it is queued normally and the window
##  is allowed to close.  When the window is closed, screen updates will
##  complete, but have no effect.
##
##  ``init()`` installs signal handlers for SIGINT (keyboard interrupt)
##  and SIGTERM (system termination request), if handlers do not already
##  exist, that generate `QUIT` events as well.  There is no way
##  to determine the cause of an `QUIT` event, but setting a signal
##  handler in your application will override the default generation of
##  quit events for that signal.
##
##  See also:
##
##  ``quit()``
##
##  There are no procedures directly affecting the quit event.

proc quitRequested*(): bool =
  pumpEvents()
  return (peepEvents(nil, 0, PEEKEVENT, QUIT, QUIT) > 0)
