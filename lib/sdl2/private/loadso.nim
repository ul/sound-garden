##  loadso.nim
##  ==========
##
##  System dependent library loading routines.
##
##  Some things to keep in mind:
##
##  * These procedures only work on C function names. Other languages may
##  have name mangling and intrinsic language support that varies from
##  compiler to compiler.
##
##  * Make sure you declare your function pointers with the same calling
##  convention as the actual library function. Your code will crash
##  mysteriously if you do not do this.
##
##  * Avoid namespace collisions. If you load a symbol from the library,
##  it is not defined whether or not it goes into the global symbol
##  namespace for the application. If it does and it conflicts with
##  symbols in your code or other shared libraries, you will not get
##  the results you expect. :)

proc loadObject*(sofile: cstring): pointer {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_LoadObject", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  This procedure dynamically loads a shared object and returns a pointer
  ##  to the object handle (or `nil` if there was an error).
  ##  The ``sofile`` parameter is a system dependent name of the object file.

proc loadFunction*(handle: pointer; name: cstring): pointer {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_LoadFunction", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Given an object ``handle``, this procedure looks up the address of the
  ##  named function in the shared object and returns it.  This address
  ##  is no longer valid after calling ``unloadObject()``.

proc unloadObject*(handle: pointer) {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_UnloadObject", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Unload a shared object from memory.
