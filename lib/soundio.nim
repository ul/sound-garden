  ## Call this function when you are ready to begin reading from the device

  ## * `instream` - (in) The input stream you want to read from.
  ## * `areas` - (out) The memory addresses you can read data from. It is OK
  ##   to modify the pointers if that helps you iterate. There might be a "hole"
  ##   in the buffer. To indicate this, `areas` will be `NULL` and `frame_count`
  ##   tells how big the hole is in frames.
  ## * `frame_count` - (in/out) - Provide the number of frames you want to read;
  ##   returns the number of frames you can actually read. The returned value
  ##   will always be less than or equal to the provided value. If the provided
  ##   value is less than `frame_count_min` from SoundIoInStream::read_callback this function
  ##   returns with #SoundIoErrorInvalid.
  ## It is your responsibility to call this function no more and no fewer than the
  ## correct number of times according to the `frame_count_min` and
  ## `frame_count_max` criteria from SoundIoInStream::read_callback.
  ## You must call this function only from the SoundIoInStream::read_callback thread context.
  ## After calling this function, read data from `areas` and then use
  ## ::soundio_instream_end_read` to actually remove the data from the buffer
  ## and move the read index forward. ::soundio_instream_end_read should not be
  ## called if the buffer is empty (`frame_count` == 0), but it should be called
  ## if there is a hole.

  ## * #SoundIoErrorStreaming
  ## * #SoundIoErrorIncompatibleDevice - in rare cases it might just now
  ##   be discovered that the device uses non-byte-aligned access, in which
  ##   case this error code is returned.
