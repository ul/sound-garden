  ##  Create a window that can be shaped with the specified position,
  ##  dimensions, and flags.
  ##
  ##  ``title`` The title of the window, in UTF-8 encoding.
  ##
  ##  ``x`` The x position of the window, `WINDOWPOS_CENTERED`,
  ##  or `WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED`.
  ##
  ##  ``y`` The y position of the window, `WINDOWPOS_CENTERED`,
  ##  or `WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED`.
  ##
  ##  ``w`` The width of the window.
  ##
  ##  ``h`` The height of the window.
  ##
  ##  ``flags``
  ##    The flags for the window, a mask of `WINDOW_BORDERLESS`
  ##    with any of the following:
  ##    `WINDOW_OPENGL`,    `WINDOW_INPUT_GRABBED`,
  ##    `WINDOW_HIDDEN`,    `WINDOW_RESIZABLE`,

  ##    `WINDOW_BORDERLESS` is always set,
  ##    and `WINDOW_FULLSCREEN` is always unset.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` The window created, or `nil` if window creation failed.

  ##
  ##  ``window`` The window to query for being shaped.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` `true` if the window is a window that can be shaped,
  ##  `false` if the window is unshaped or `nil`.

proc setWindowShape*(

  ##
  ##  ``shape_mode`` An empty shape-mode structure to fill,
