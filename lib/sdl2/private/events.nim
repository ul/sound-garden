  ##  If the filter returns `1`, then the event will be added

  ##  as it may run in a different thread!
  ##
  ##  There is one caveat when dealing with the ``QuitEvent`` event type.  The
  ##  event filter is only called when the window manager desires to close the
  ##  application window.  If the event filter returns `1`, then the window
  ##  will be closed, otherwise the window will remain open if possible.
