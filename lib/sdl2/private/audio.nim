  ##  use.  You should normally use ``init()`` or ``initSubSystem()``.

  ##
  ##  ``Internal``: These procedures are used internally, and should not be used

  ##  use.  You should normally use ``init()`` or ``initSubSystem()``.

proc getCurrentAudioDriver*(): cstring {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  This procedure returns the name of the current audio driver, or `nil`
  ##  if no driver has been initialized.

proc openAudio*(desired: ptr AudioSpec; obtained: ptr AudioSpec): cint {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_OpenAudio", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  This procedure opens the audio device with the desired parameters, and
  ##  returns `0` if successful, placing the actual hardware parameters in the
  ##  object pointed to by ``obtained``.  If ``obtained`` is `nil`, the audio
  ##  data passed to the callback procedure will be guaranteed to be in the
  ##  requested format, and will be automatically converted to the hardware
  ##  audio format if necessary.  This procedure returns `-1` if it failed
  ##  to open the audio device, or couldn't set up the audio thread.
  ##
  ##  When filling in the ``desired`` audio spec object,
  ##  * ``desired.freq`` should be the desired audio frequency
  ##    in samples-per- second.
  ##  * ``desired.format`` should be the desired audio format.
  ##  * ``desired.samples`` is the desired size of the audio buffer,
  ##    in samples.  This number should be a power of two, and may be adjusted
  ##    by the audio driver to a value more suitable for the hardware.
  ##    Good values seem to range between `512` and `8096` inclusive, depending
  ##    on the  application and CPU speed.  Smaller values yield faster
  ##    response time, but can lead to underflow if the application is doing
  ##    heavy processing and cannot fill the audio buffer in time.  A stereo
  ##    sample consists of both right and left channels in LR ordering.
  ##
  ##    Note that the number of samples is directly related to time by the
  ##    following formula:
  ##
  ##    `ms = (samples*1000)/freq`
  ##
  ##  * ``desired.size`` is the size in bytes of the audio buffer, and is
  ##    calculated by ``openAudio()``.
  ##  * ``desired.silence`` is the value used to set the buffer to silence,
  ##    and is calculated by ``openAudio()``.
  ##  * ``desired.callback`` should be set to a procedure that will be called
  ##    when the audio device is ready for more data.  It is passed a pointer
  ##    to the audio buffer, and the length in bytes of the audio buffer.
  ##    This procedure usually runs in a separate thread, and so you should
  ##    protect data structures that it accesses by calling ``lockAudio()``
  ##    and ``unlockAudio()`` in your code. Alternately, you may pass a `nil`
  ##    pointer here, and call ``queueAudio()`` with some frequency, to queue
  ##    more audio samples to be played (or for capture devices, call
  ##    ``sdl.dequeueAudio()`` with some frequency, to obtain audio samples).
  ##  * ``desired.userdata`` is passed as the first parameter to your callback
  ##    procedure. If you passed a `nil` callback, this value is ignored.
  ##
  ##  The audio device starts out playing silence when it's opened, and should
  ##  be enabled for playing by calling ``pauseAudio(0)`` when you are ready
  ##  for your audio callback procedure to be called.  Since the audio driver
  ##  may modify the requested size of the audio buffer, you should allocate
  ##  any local mixing buffers after you open the audio device.

  ##  still allow a specific host to be specified to ``openAudioDevice()``.

  ##  Queue more audio on non-callback devices.
  ##
  ##  (If you are looking to retrieve queued audio from a non-callback capture
  ##  device, you want ``sdl.dequeueAudio()`` instead. This will return `-1`
  ##  to signify an error if you use it with capture devices.)
  ##
  ##  SDL offers two ways to feed audio to the device: you can either supply a
  ##  callback that SDL triggers with some frequency to obtain more audio
  ##  (pull method), or you can supply no callback, and then SDL will expect
  ##  you to supply data at regular intervals (push method) with this procedure.
  ##
  ##  There are no limits on the amount of data you can queue, short of
  ##  exhaustion of address space. Queued data will drain to the device as
  ##  necessary without further intervention from you. If the device needs
  ##  audio but there is not enough queued, it will play silence to make up
  ##  the difference. This means you will have skips in your audio playback
  ##  if you aren't routinely queueing sufficient data.
  ##
  ##  This procedure copies the supplied data, so you are safe to free it when
  ##  the procedure returns. This procedure is thread-safe, but queueing to the
  ##  same device from two threads at once does not promise which buffer will
  ##  be queued first.
  ##
  ##  You may not queue audio on a device that is using an application-supplied
  ##  callback; doing so returns an error. You have to use the audio callback
  ##  or queue audio with this procedure, but not both.

  ##  SDL offers two ways to retrieve audio from a capture device: you can

  ##
  ##  There are no limits on the amount of data you can queue, short of
  ##  exhaustion of address space. Data from the device will keep queuing as
  ##  necessary without further intervention from you. This means you will
  ##  eventually run out of memory if you aren't routinely dequeueing data.
  ##
  ##  Capture devices will not queue data when paused; if you are expecting
  ##  to not need captured audio for some length of time, use
  ##  ``sdl.pauseAudioDevice()`` to stop the capture device from queueing more
  ##  data. This can be useful during, say, level loading times. When
  ##  unpaused, capture devices will start queueing data from that point,
  ##  having flushed any capturable data available while paused.
  ##
  ##  This procedure is thread-safe, but dequeueing from the same device from
  ##  two threads at once does not promise which thread will dequeued data
  ##  first.

  ##  For playback device:
  ##
  ##    This is the number of bytes that have been queued for playback with

  ##    number may shrink at any time, so this only informs of pending data.
  ##
  ##    Once we've sent it to the hardware, this procedure can not decide the
  ##    exact byte boundary of what has been played. It's possible that we just
  ##    gave the hardware several kilobytes right before you called this
  ##    procedure, but it hasn't played any of it yet, or maybe half of it, etc.
  ##
  ##  For capture device:
  ##
  ##    This is the number of bytes that have been captured by the device and
  ##    are waiting for you to dequeue. This number may grow at any time, so
  ##    this only informs of the lower-bound of available data.

  ##
  ##  Immediately after this call, ``sdl.getQueuedAudioSize()`` will return `0`.
  ##  For playback devices, the hardware will start playing silence if more
  ##  audio isn't queued. Unpaused capture devices will start filling the queue
  ##  again as soon as they have more data available (which, depending on the
  ##  state of the hardware and the thread, could be before this function call
  ##  returns!).
  ##
  ##  This will not prevent playback of queued audio that's already been sent
  ##  to the hardware, as we can not undo that, so expect there to be some
