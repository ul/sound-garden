##  ==========
##
##  The SDL haptic subsystem allows you to control
##  haptic (force feedback) devices.
##
##  The basic usage is as follows:
##  * Initialize the Subsystem (::SDL_INIT_HAPTIC).
##  * Open a haptic Device.
##    * ``hapticOpen()`` to open from index.
##    * ``hapticOpenFromJoystick()`` to open from an existing joystick.
##  * Create an effect (``HapticEffect``).
##  * Upload the effect with ``hapticNewEffect()``.
##  * Run the effect with ``hapticRunEffect()``.
##  * (optional) Free the effect with ``hapticDestroyEffect()``.
##  * Close the haptic device with ``hapticClose()``.

    ##  Used to play a device an infinite number of times.
    ##
    ##  ``hapticRunEffect()``

type
  HapticDirection* = object ##  \
    ##  Structure that represents a haptic direction.
    ##
    ##  This is the direction where the force comes from,
    ##  instead of the direction in which the force is exerted.
    ##
    ##  Directions can be specified by:
    ##  * `HAPTIC_POLAR` : Specified by polar coordinates.
    ##  * `HAPTIC_CARTESIAN` : Specified by cartesian coordinates.
    ##  * `HAPTIC_SPHERICAL` : Specified by spherical coordinates.
    ##
    ##  Cardinal directions of the haptic device
    ##  are relative to the positioning of the device.
    ##  North is considered to be away from the user.
    ##
    ##  If type is `HAPTIC_POLAR`, direction is encoded by hundredths of a
    ##  degree starting north and turning clockwise.
    ##  `HAPTIC_POLAR` only uses the first ``dir`` parameter.
    ##
    ##  The cardinal directions would be:
    ##  * North: `0` (0 degrees)
    ##  * East:  `9000` (90 degrees)
    ##  * South: `18000` (180 degrees)
    ##  * West:  `27000` (270 degrees)
    ##
    ##  If type is `HAPTIC_CARTESIAN`, direction is encoded by three positions
    ##  (X axis, Y axis and Z axis (with 3 axes)).
    ##  `HAPTIC_CARTESIAN` uses the first three ``dir`` parameters.
    ##
    ##  The cardinal directions would be:
    ##  * North:  `0,-1, 0`
    ##  * East:  `1, 0, 0`
    ##  * South:  `0, 1, 0`
    ##  * West:   `-1, 0, 0`
    ##
    ##  The Z axis represents the height of the effect if supported, otherwise
    ##  it's unused.  In cartesian encoding (1, 2) would be the same as (2, 4),
    ##  you can use any multiple you want, only the direction matters.
    ##
    ##  If type is `HAPTIC_SPHERICAL`, direction is encoded by two rotations.
    ##  The first two ``dir`` parameters are used.
    ##
    ##  The ``dir`` parameters are as follows
    ##  (all values are in hundredths of degrees):
    ##  * Degrees from (`1, 0`) rotated towards (`0, 1`).
    ##  * Degrees towards (`0, 0, 1`) (device needs at least 3 axes).
    ##
    ##  Example of force coming from the south with all encodings
    ##  (force coming from the south means the user will have to pull
    ##  the stick to counteract):
    ##
    ##  .. code-block:: nim
    ##    var direction: HapticDirection
    ##    # Cartesian directions
    ##    direction.type = HAPTIC_CARTESIAN
    ##    direction.dir[0] = 0  # X position
    ##    direction.dir[1] = 1  # Y position
    ##    # Assuming the device has 2 axes,
    ##    # we don't need to specify third parameter.
    ##    # Polar directions
    ##    direction.type = HAPTIC_POLAR
    ##    direction.dir[0] = 18000  # Polar only uses first parameter
    ##    # Spherical coordinates
    ##    direction.type = HAPTIC_SPHERICAL # Spherical encoding
    ##    direction.dir[0] = 9000
    ##    # Since we only have two axes we don't need more parameters.

    ##  *  `9000`: Displaced 25% of its period.

    ##
    ##  All values max at `32767` (`0x7FFF`).
    ##  Signed values also can be negative.
    ##  Time values unless specified otherwise are in milliseconds.
    ##
    ##  You can also pass `HAPTIC_INFINITY` to length instead of a `0`-`32767`
    ##  value.  Neither delay, interval, attack_length nor fade_length support
    ##  `HAPTIC_INFINITY`.  Fade will also not be used since effect never ends.
    ##
    ##  Additionally, the `HAPTIC_RAMP` effect does not support a duration of
    ##  `HAPTIC_INFINITY`.
    ##
    ##  Button triggers may not be supported on all devices, it is advised to
    ##  not use them if possible.  Buttons start at index `1` instead of index
    ##  `0` like the joystick.
    ##
    ##  If both ``attack_length`` and ``fade_level`` are `0`,
    ##  the envelope is not used, otherwise both values are used.
    ##
    ##  Common parts:
    ##

    ##    # Replay - All effects have this
    ##    length: uint32      # Duration of effect (ms).
    ##    delay: uint16       # Delay before starting effect.
    ##    # Trigger - All effects have this
    ##    button: uint16      # Button that triggers effect.
    ##    interval: uint16    # How soon before effect can be triggered again.
    ##    # Envelope - All effects except condition effects have this
    ##    attack_length: uint16   # Duration of the attack (ms).
    ##    attack_level: uint16    # Level at the start of the attack.
    ##    fade_length: uint16     # Duration of the fade out (ms).
