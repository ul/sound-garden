type
  PowerState* {.size: sizeof(cint).} = enum ##  \
    ##  The basic state for the system's power supply.
    POWERSTATE_UNKNOWN,     ##  cannot determine power status
    POWERSTATE_ON_BATTERY,  ##  Not plugged in, running on the battery
    POWERSTATE_NO_BATTERY,  ##  Plugged in, no battery available
    POWERSTATE_CHARGING,    ##  Plugged in, charging battery
    POWERSTATE_CHARGED      ##  Plugged in, battery charged

proc getPowerInfo*(secs: ptr cint; pct: ptr cint): PowerState {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetPowerInfo", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the current power supply details.
  ##
  ##  ``secs`` Seconds of battery life left. You can pass a `nil` here if
  ##  you don't care. Will return `-1` if we can't determine a value,
  ##  or we're not running on a battery.
  ##
  ##  ``pct`` Percentage of battery life left, between `0` and `100`. You can
  ##  pass a `nil` here if you don't care. Will return `-1` if we can't
  ##  determine a value, or we're not running on a battery.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` The state of the battery (if any).
