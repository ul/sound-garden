##  hints.nim
##  =========
##
##  Official documentation for SDL configuration variables.
##
##  This file contains procedures to set and get configuration hints,
##  as well as listing each of them alphabetically.
##
##  The convention for naming hints is `HINT_X`, where "X" is
##  the environment variable that can be used to override the default.
##
##  In general these hints are just that - they may or may not be
##  supported or applicable on any given platform, but they provide
##  a way for an application or user to give the library a hint as
##  to how they would like the library to work.

const
  HINT_FRAMEBUFFER_ACCELERATION* = "SDL_FRAMEBUFFER_ACCELERATION" ##  \
    ##  A variable controlling how 3D acceleration is used  to accelerate the
    ##  SDL screen surface.
    ##
    ##  SDL can try to accelerate the SDL screen surface by using streaming
    ##  textures with a 3D rendering engine.  This variable controls whether
    ##  and how this is done.
    ##
    ##  This variable can be set to the following values:
    ##  * "0" - Disable 3D acceleration
    ##  * "1" - Enable 3D acceleration, using the default renderer.
    ##  * "X" - Enable 3D acceleration, using X where X is one of the valid
    ##  rendering drivers.  (e.g. "direct3d", "opengl", etc.)
    ##
    ##  By default SDL tries to make a best guess for each platform whether
    ##  to use acceleration or not.

const
  HINT_RENDER_DRIVER* = "SDL_RENDER_DRIVER" ##  \
    ##  A variable specifying which render driver to use.
    ##
    ##  If the application doesn't pick a specific renderer to use, this
    ##  variable specifies the name of the preferred renderer.  If the
    ##  preferred renderer can't be initialized, the normal default renderer
    ##  is used.
    ##
    ##  This variable is case insensitive and can be set to the following
    ##  values:
    ##  * "direct3d"
    ##  * "opengl"
    ##  * "opengles2"
    ##  * "opengles"
    ##  * "metal"
    ##  * "software"
    ##
    ##  The default varies by platform, but it's the first one in the list that
    ##  is available on the current platform.

const
  HINT_RENDER_OPENGL_SHADERS* = "SDL_RENDER_OPENGL_SHADERS" ##  \
    ##  A variable controlling whether the OpenGL render driver uses shaders
    ##  if they are available.
    ##
    ##  This variable can be set to the following values:
    ##  * "0" - Disable shaders
    ##  * "1" - Enable shaders

    ##  for thread-safe operations.
    ##
    ##  This variable can be set to the following values:
    ##  * "0"       - Thread-safety is not enabled (faster)
    ##  * "1"       - Thread-safety is enabled
    ##
    ##  By default the Direct3D device is created with thread-safety disabled.

const
  HINT_RENDER_DIRECT3D11_DEBUG* = "SDL_RENDER_DIRECT3D11_DEBUG" ##  \
    ##  A variable controlling whether to enable Direct3D 11+'s Debug Layer.
    ##
    ##  This variable does not have any effect on the Direct3D 9 based renderer.
    ##
    ##  This variable can be set to the following values:
    ##  * "0"       - Disable Debug Layer use
    ##  * "1"       - Enable Debug Layer use
    ##
    ##  By default, SDL does not use Direct3D Debug Layer.

const
  HINT_RENDER_LOGICAL_SIZE_MODE* = "SDL_RENDER_LOGICAL_SIZE_MODE" ##  \

    ##    to fit the entire rendering on screen
    ##  * "1" or "overscan"  - Will zoom the rendering
    ##    so it fills the entire screen, allowing edges to be drawn offscreen
    ##
    ##  By default letterbox is used.

const
  HINT_RENDER_SCALE_QUALITY* = "SDL_RENDER_SCALE_QUALITY" ##  \
    ##  A variable controlling the scaling quality
    ##
    ##  This variable can be set to the following values:
    ##  * "0" or "nearest" - Nearest pixel sampling
    ##  * "1" or "linear"  - Linear filtering (supported by OpenGL and Direct3D)
    ##  * "2" or "best"    - Currently this is the same as "linear"
    ##
    ##  By default nearest pixel sampling is used.

const
  HINT_RENDER_VSYNC* = "SDL_RENDER_VSYNC" ##  \
    ##  A variable controlling whether updates to the SDL screen surface
    ##  should be synchronized with the vertical refresh, to avoid tearing.
    ##
    ##  This variable can be set to the following values:
    ##  * "0"       - Disable vsync
    ##  * "1"       - Enable vsync

    ##  * "0"       - Disable _NET_WM_PING
    ##  * "1"       - Enable _NET_WM_PING
    ##
    ##  By default SDL will use _NET_WM_PING, but for applications that know
    ##  they will not always be able to respond to ping requests in a timely
    ##  manner they can turn it off to avoid the window manager thinking the
    ##  app is hung.
    ##
    ##  The hint is checked in ``createWindow()``.

    ##  * "1"       - Touch events will generate mouse events
    ##
    ##  By default SDL will generate mouse events for touch events.

const
  HINT_VIDEO_MINIMIZE_ON_FOCUS_LOSS* = "SDL_VIDEO_MINIMIZE_ON_FOCUS_LOSS" ##  \
    ##  Minimize your ``Window`` if it loses key focus when in fullscreen mode.
    ##  Defaults to `true`.

const
  HINT_IDLE_TIMER_DISABLED* = "SDL_IOS_IDLE_TIMER_DISABLED" ##  \
    ##  A variable controlling whether the idle timer is disabled on iOS.
    ##
    ##  When an iOS app does not receive touches for some time, the screen is
    ##  dimmed automatically. For games where the accelerometer is the only

    ##  setting this hint.
    ##
    ##  As of SDL 2.0.4, ``sdl.enableScreenSaver()`` and
    ##  ``sdl.disableScreenSaver()`` accomplish the same thing on iOS.
    ##  They should be preferred over this hint.
    ##
    ##  This variable can be set to the following values:

    ##  A variable controlling whether controllers used with the Apple TV
    ##  generate UI events.
    ##
    ##  When UI events are generated by controller input, the app will be
    ##  backgrounded when the Apple TV remote's menu button is pressed, and
    ##  when the pause or B buttons on gamepads are pressed.
    ##
    ##  More information about properly making use of controllers for the

    ##    (default for windowed applications)
    ##  * "1"     - The indicator bar is hidden and is shown when the screen is
    ##    touched (useful for movie playback applications)
    ##  * "2"     - The indicator bar is dim and the first swipe makes it
    ##    visible and the second swipe performs the "home" action
    ##    (default for fullscreen applications)

const
  HINT_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK* = "SDL_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK" ##  \

const
  HINT_GAMECONTROLLER_IGNORE_DEVICES_EXCEPT* =
    "SDL_GAMECONTROLLER_IGNORE_DEVICES_EXCEPT"  ##  \
    ##  If set, all devices will be skipped when scanning for game controllers
    ##  except for the ones listed in this variable.
    ##
    ##  The format of the string is a comma separated list of USB VID/PID pairs

  HINT_QTWAYLAND_CONTENT_ORIENTATION* =
    "SDL_QTWAYLAND_CONTENT_ORIENTATION" ##  \
    ##  A variable describing the content orientation
    ##  on QtWayland-based platforms.
    ##
    ##  On QtWayland platforms, windows are rotated client-side to allow for
    ##  custom transitions. In order to correctly position overlays
    ##  (e.g. volume bar) and gestures (e.g. events view, close/minimize
    ##  gestures), the system needs to know in which orientation the
    ##  application is currently drawing its contents.
    ##
    ##  This does not cause the window to be rotated or resized, the application
    ##  needs to take care of drawing the content in the right orientation (the
    ##  framebuffer is always in portrait mode).
    ##
    ##  This variable can be one of the following values:
    ##
    ##  "primary" (default), "portrait", "landscape",

    ##  "OverridesSystemGestures" disables swipe gestures.
    ##
    ##  This variable is a space-separated list of the following values
    ##  (empty = no flags):
    ##
    ##  "OverridesSystemGestures", "StaysOnTop", "BypassWindowManager"

const
  HINT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE* = "SDL_THREAD_STACK_SIZE" ##  \
    ##  A string specifying SDL's threads stack size in bytes
    ##  or `0` for the backend's default size.
    ##
    ##  Use this hint in case you need to set SDL's threads stack size to other
    ##  than the default.
    ##
    ##  This is specially useful if you build SDL against a non glibc libc
    ##  library (such as musl) which provides a relatively small default thread
    ##  stack size (a few kilobytes versus the default 8MB glibc uses).
    ##
    ##  Support for this hint is currently available only in the pthread,
    ##  Windows, and PSP backend.

const

    ##
    ##  To setup a URL to an app's privacy policy, set
    ##  `HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL` before calling any ``sdl.init()``
    ##  procedures. The contents of the hint should be a valid URL.
    ##  For example, "http://www.example.com".

const
  HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON* = "SDL_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON" ##  \
    ##  Allows back-button-press events on Windows Phone to be marked
    ##  as handled.
    ##
    ##  Windows Phone devices typically feature a Back button. When pressed,
    ##  the OS will emit back-button-press events, which apps are expected to
    ##  handle in an appropriate manner. If apps do not explicitly mark these
    ##  events as 'Handled', then the OS will invoke its default behavior for
    ##  unhandled back-button-press events, which on Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 is
    ##  to terminate the app (and attempt to switch to the previous app, or to
    ##  the device's home screen).
    ##
    ##  Setting the `HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON` hint to `1` will cause SDL
    ##  to mark back-button-press events as 'Handled', if and when one is sent
    ##  to the app.
    ##
    ##  Internally, Windows Phone sends back button events as parameters to
    ##  special back-button-press callback procedures. Apps that need to respond
    ##  to back-button-press events are expected to register one or more
    ##  callback procedures for such, shortly after being launched (during the
    ##  app's initialization phase). After the back button is pressed, the OS
    ##  will invoke these callbacks. If the app's callback(s) do not explicitly
    ##  mark the event as handled by the time they return, or if the app never
    ##  registers one of these callback, the OS will consider the event
    ##  un-handled, and it will apply its default back button behavior
    ##  (terminate the app).
    ##
    ##  SDL registers its own back-button-press callback with the Windows Phone
    ##  OS.  This callback will emit a pair of SDL key-press events
    ##  (`sdl.KEYDOWN` and `sdl.KEYUP`), each with a scancode of
    ##  `SCANCODE_AC_BACK`, after which it will check the contents of the hint,
    ##  `HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON`.
    ##
    ##  If the hint's value is set to `1`, the back button event's 'Handled'
    ##  property will get set to `true`.  If the hint's value is set to
    ##  something else, or if it is unset, SDL will leave the event's 'Handled'
    ##  property alone. (By default, the OS sets this property to `false`,
    ##  to note.)
    ##
    ##  SDL apps can either set `HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON` well before a
    ##  back button is pressed, or can set it in direct-response to a
    ##  back button being pressed.
    ##
    ##  In order to get notified when a back button is pressed, SDL apps should
    ##  register a callback procedure with ``addEventWatch()``, and have it
    ##  listen for `sdl.KEYDOWN` events that have a scancode of
    ##  `SCANCODE_AC_BACK`.
    ##
    ##  (Alternatively, `sdl.KEYUP` events can be listened-for. Listening for
    ##  either event type is suitable.) Any value of
    ##  `HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON` set by such a callback, will be applied
    ##  to the OS' current back-button-press event.
    ##

const
  HINT_VIDEO_DOUBLE_BUFFER* = "SDL_VIDEO_DOUBLE_BUFFER"
    ##  Tell the video driver that we only want a double buffer.
    ##
    ##  By default, most lowlevel 2D APIs will use a triple buffer scheme that
    ##  wastes no CPU time on waiting for vsync after issuing a flip, but
    ##  introduces a frame of latency. On the other hand, using a double buffer
    ##  scheme instead is recommended for cases where low latency is an
    ##  important factor because we save a whole frame of latency.
    ##  We do so by waiting for vsync immediately after issuing a flip,
    ##  usually just after ``eglSwapBuffers`` call in the backend's
    ##  ``*_SwapWindow`` procedure.
    ##
    ##  Since it's driver-specific, it's only supported where possible and

    ##  * Raspberry Pi (raspberrypi)

const
  HINT_OPENGL_ES_DRIVER* = "SDL_OPENGL_ES_DRIVER" ##  \
    ##  A variable controlling what driver to use for OpenGL ES contexts.
    ##
    ##  On some platforms, currently Windows and X11, OpenGL drivers may support
    ##  creating contexts with an OpenGL ES profile. By default SDL uses these
    ##  profiles, when available, otherwise it attempts to load an OpenGL ES
    ##  library, e.g. that provided by the ANGLE project. This variable controls
    ##  whether SDL follows this default behaviour or will always load an
    ##  OpenGL ES library.
    ##
    ##  Circumstances where this is useful include:
    ##  * Testing an app with a particular OpenGL ES implementation, e.g ANGLE,
    ##    or emulator, e.g. those from ARM, Imagination or Qualcomm.
    ##  * Resolving OpenGL ES function addresses at link time by linking with

    ##
    ##  ``Caution:`` for an application to work with the default behaviour
    ##  across different OpenGL drivers it must query the OpenGL ES function
    ##  addresses at run time using ``glGetProcAddress()``.
    ##
    ##  This variable is ignored on most platforms because OpenGL ES is native
    ##  or not supported.
    ##
    ##  This variable can be set to the following values:
    ##  * "0" - Use ES profile of OpenGL, if available. (Default when not set.)
