# Procedure prototypes

proc initFramerate*(manager: ptr FPSmanager) {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_initFramerate", dynlib: SDL2_GFX_LIB.}
  ##  Initialize the framerate manager, set default framerate
  ##  of 30Hz and reset delay interpolation.

proc setFramerate*(manager: ptr FPSmanager; rate: uint32): cint {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_setFramerate", dynlib: SDL2_GFX_LIB.}
  ##  Set the framerate in Hz.
  ##
  ##  Sets a new framerate for the manager and reset delay interpolation.
  ##  Rate values must be between `FPS_LOWER_LIMIT` and `FPS_UPPER_LIMIT`
  ##  inclusive to be accepted.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` `0` or value for sucess and `-1` for error.

proc getFramerate*(manager: ptr FPSmanager): cint {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_getFramerate", dynlib: SDL2_GFX_LIB.}
  ##  ``Return`` the current target framerate in Hz or `-1` on error.

proc getFramecount*(manager: ptr FPSmanager): cint {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_getFramecount", dynlib: SDL2_GFX_LIB.}
  ##  Get the current framecount from the framerate manager.
  ##  A frame is counted each time ``framerateDelay()`` is called.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` current frame count or `-1` on error.

proc framerateDelay*(manager: ptr FPSmanager): uint32 {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_framerateDelay", dynlib: SDL2_GFX_LIB.}
  ##  Generate a delay to accomodate currently set framerate.
  ##  Call once in the graphics/rendering loop.
  ##  If the computer cannot keep up with the rate (i.e. drawing too slow),
  ##  the delay is zero and the delay interpolation is reset.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` time that passed since the last call to the procedure in ms.
  ##  May return `0`.
