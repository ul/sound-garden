##  Atomic operations.
##
##  IMPORTANT:
##  ----------
##
##  If you are not an expert in concurrent lockless programming, you should
##  only be using the atomic lock and reference counting procedures in this
##  file.  In all other cases you should be protecting your data structures
##  with full mutexes.
##
##  The list of "safe" procedures to use are:
##  * ``atomicLock()``
##  * ``atomicUnlock()``
##  * ``atomicIncRef()``
##  * ``atomicDecRef()``
##
##  ``Seriously, here be dragons!``
##
##  You can find out a little more about lockless programming and the
##  subtle issues that can arise here:
##
##  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee418650%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
##
##  There's also lots of good information here:

##
##  These operations may or may not actually be implemented using
##  processor specific atomic operations. When possible they are
##  implemented as true processor specific atomic operations. When that
##  is not possible the are implemented using locks that *do* use the
##  available atomic operations.
##
##  All of the atomic operations that modify memory are full memory barriers.

##  AtomicLock
##  ----------
##
##  The atomic locks are efficient spinlocks using CPU instructions,
##  but are vulnerable to starvation and can spin forever if a thread
##  holding a lock has been terminated.  For this reason you should
##  minimize the code executed inside an atomic lock and never do
##  expensive things like API or system calls while holding them.
##
##  The atomic locks are not safe to lock recursively.
##
##  ``Porting Note:``
##  The spin lock procedures and type are required and can not be
##  emulated because they are used in the atomic emulation code.

  ##  Try to lock a spin lock by setting it to a non-zero value.

  ##  ``lock`` Points to the lock.

  ##  ``Return`` `true` if the lock succeeded,
  ##  `false` if the lock is already held.

    cdecl, importc: "SDL_AtomicLock", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Lock a spin lock by setting it to a non-zero value.

  ##  Unlock a spin lock by setting it to `0`. Always returns immediately.
  ##
  ##  ``lock`` Points to the lock.
