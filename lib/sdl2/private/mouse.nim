# Procedures

proc getMouseFocus*(): ptr Window {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetMouseFocus", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the window which currently has mouse focus.

proc getMouseState*(x: ptr cint; y: ptr cint): uint32 {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetMouseState", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Retrieve the current state of the mouse.
  ##
  ##  The current button state is returned as a button bitmask, which can
  ##  be tested using the ``button()`` template, and x and y are set to the
  ##  mouse cursor position relative to the focus window for the currently
  ##  selected mouse.  You can pass `nil` for either x or y.

proc getGlobalMouseState*(x: ptr cint; y: ptr cint): uint32 {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetGlobalMouseState", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Get the current state of the mouse, in relation to the desktop.
  ##
  ##  This works just like ``getMouseState()``, but the coordinates will be
  ##  reported relative to the top-left of the desktop. This can be useful if
  ##  you need to track the mouse outside of a specific window and
  ##  ``captureMouse()`` doesn't fit your needs. For example, it could be
  ##  useful if you need to track the mouse while dragging a window, where
  ##  coordinates relative to a window might not be in sync at all times.
  ##
  ##  ``Note`` ``getMouseState()`` returns the mouse position as SDL understands
  ##  it from the last pump of the event queue. This procedure, however,
  ##  queries the OS for the current mouse position, and as such, might
  ##  be a slightly less efficient procedure. Unless you know what you're
  ##  doing and have a good reason to use this procedure, you probably want
  ##  ``getMouseState()`` instead.
  ##
  ##  ``x`` Returns the current X coord, relative to the desktop. Can be `nil`.
  ##
  ##  ``y`` Returns the current Y coord, relative to the desktop. Can be `nil`.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` the current button state as a bitmask, which can be tested
  ##  using the ``sdl.BUTTON(X)`` template.
  ##
  ##  See also:
  ##
  ##  ``getMouseState()``

proc getRelativeMouseState*(x: ptr cint; y: ptr cint): uint32 {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetRelativeMouseState", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Retrieve the relative state of the mouse.
  ##
  ##  The current button state is returned as a button bitmask, which can
  ##  be tested using the ``button()`` template, and x and y are set to the
  ##  mouse deltas since the last call to ``getRelativeMouseState()``.

proc warpMouseInWindow*(window: ptr Window; x: cint; y: cint) {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_WarpMouseInWindow", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Moves the mouse to the given position within the window.
  ##
  ##  ``window`` The window to move the mouse into,
  ##  or `nil` for the current mouse focus
  ##
  ##  ``x`` The x coordinate within the window
  ##
  ##  ``y`` The y coordinate within the window
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` This procedure generates a mouse motion event.

proc warpMouseGlobal*(x: cint; y: cint): cint {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_WarpMouseGlobal", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Moves the mouse to the given position in global screen space.
  ##
  ##  ``x`` The x coordinate
  ##
  ##  ``y`` The y coordinate
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` `0` on success, `-1` on error
  ##  (usually: unsupported by a platform).
  ##
  ##  ``Note`` This procedure generates a mouse motion event.

proc setRelativeMouseMode*(enabled: bool): cint {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Set relative mouse mode.
  ##
  ##  ``enabled`` Whether or not to enable relative mode
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` `0` on success, or `-1` if relative mode is not supported.
  ##
  ##  While the mouse is in relative mode, the cursor is hidden, and the
  ##  driver will try to report continuous motion in the current window.
  ##  Only relative motion events will be delivered, the mouse position
  ##  will not change.
  ##
  ##  ``Note:`` This procedure will flush any pending mouse motion.
  ##
  ##  See also:
  ##
  ##  ``getRelativeMouseMode()``

proc captureMouse*(enabled: bool): cint {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_CaptureMouse", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Capture the mouse, to track input outside an SDL window.
  ##
  ##  ``enabled`` Whether or not to enable capturing
  ##
  ##  Capturing enables your app to obtain mouse events globally, instead of
  ##  just within your window. Not all video targets support this procedure.
  ##  When capturing is enabled, the current window will get all mouse events,
  ##  but unlike relative mode, no change is made to the cursor and it is
  ##  not restrained to your window.
  ##
  ##  This procedure may also deny mouse input to other windows - both those in
  ##  your application and others on the system - so you should use this
  ##  procedure sparingly, and in small bursts. For example, you might want to
  ##  track the mouse while the user is dragging something, until the user
  ##  releases a mouse button. It is not recommended that you capture the mouse
  ##  for long periods of time, such as the entire time your app is running.
  ##
  ##  While captured, mouse events still report coordinates relative to the
  ##  current (foreground) window, but those coordinates may be outside the
  ##  bounds of the window (including negative values). Capturing is only
  ##  allowed for the foreground window. If the window loses focus while
  ##  capturing, the capture will be disabled automatically.
  ##
  ##  While capturing is enabled, the current window will have the
  ##  `WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE` flag set.
  ##
  ##  ``Return`` `0` on success, or `-1` if not supported.

proc getRelativeMouseMode*(): bool {.
    cdecl, importc: "SDL_GetRelativeMouseMode", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Query whether relative mouse mode is enabled.

proc createCursor*(
    data: ptr uint8; mask: ptr uint8;
    w: cint; h: cint; hot_x: cint; hot_y: cint): Cursor {.
      cdecl, importc: "SDL_CreateCursor", dynlib: SDL2_LIB.}
  ##  Create a cursor, using the specified bitmap data and mask (in MSB format).
  ##
  ##  The cursor width must be a multiple of 8 bits.
  ##
  ##  The cursor is created in black and white according to the following:
